  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Hither installed. To complete setup:

        # Root phase (writes /etc/synthetic.conf, /etc/auto_master,
        # /usr/local/sbin/hither-write-map, /etc/sudoers.d/hither-write-map,
        # /usr/local/libexec/hither/, /Library/LaunchDaemons/...)
        sudo #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/hither bootstrap

        # User phase (writes ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.johnrandall.hither.sync.plist)
        hither bootstrap --user-only

        # Add your first NAS
        hither subscribe <nas> --user <dsm-user>

      /Hither is materialized at bootstrap time via `apfs.util -t` — no
      reboot is needed in normal cases. If `ls /Hither` shows nothing
      after install, reboot once as a fallback; `hither doctor` will
      also flag a missing synthetic root.

      See `hither doctor` for a health snapshot, and the README at
      #{homepage} for the full lay of the land.

      The LaunchDaemon Label `com.johnrandall.hither.bootstrap` and the
      LaunchAgent Label `com.johnrandall.hither.sync` carry the original
      author's reverse-DNS prefix. These are historical and are not
      renamed across versions — they're baked into existing installs.
